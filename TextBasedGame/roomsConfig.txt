Torture Chamber: Welcome to the Torture Chamber. Rusty chains dangle from the walls, and ominous devices occupy the center of the room. The air feels heavy with suffering.
Cavern of Shadows: You enter the Cavern of Shadows. The low ceiling forces you to crouch, and the walls play host to dancing shadows. The air is thick with an unsettling silence.
Flooded Passage: Navigating the Flooded Passage, the ground is submerged in ankle-deep water. Algae-covered walls surround you, and a faint glow reflects off the rippling water.
